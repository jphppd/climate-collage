        Continental glaciers (or ice sheets) are in Greenland and Antarctica. If they melt completely, they will cause a
        rise in ocean levels of 7 meters for Greenland and 54 meters for Antarctica. During the last ice age, ice caps
        were so huge that the sea level was 120 m lower than today.
