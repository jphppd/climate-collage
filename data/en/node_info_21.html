        Here we are referring to the average temperature of air above the ground on Earth. It has increased by 1째C since
        1900. Depending on the scenarios, the rise in temperature could reach 2째C to 5째C by 2100. At the end of the last
        ice age years, the average temperature was only 5째C lower than today's... And deglaciation lasted 10,000 years!
