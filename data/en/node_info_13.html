        The greenhouse effect is a natural phenomenon (by the way, the first GHG is water vapor). Without greenhouse
        effect, the planet would be 33°C colder and life as we know it would not be possible…But CO<sub>2</sub> and other GHGs
        related to human activity increase the natural greenhouse effect and unbalance the climate.
